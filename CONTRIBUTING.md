# Contributing to Topic Play

👍🎉 Thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

If you'd like to submit a channel, the easiest way to do so is by opening an issue. Alternatively, you can also submit directly on the [site](https://topicplay.com) through chat or email.

Channels will be both added on the Topic Play website and the README. The README is generated from the website's API data.

All English channels will be added if they fit the topic. Feel free to also submit or suggest a new topic.
